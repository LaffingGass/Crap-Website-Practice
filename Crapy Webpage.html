    <h2>How I used Crap in my Webpage</h2>
    <p>C=I used contrast in my website by using brite colors and using heading and also different sized text.</p>
    <p>R=I used repition by keeping color scheme the same and also using some of the same organization.</p>
    <p>A=I used alignment in the center so it had a clean and same design sence I did not have much text on the page.</p>
    <p>P=I used proximity by having clearly devited bars in my page.</p>
